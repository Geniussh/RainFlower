# RainFlower <br /><br />

This is an intelligent umbrella, which rotates its surface to different angles based on the real-time wind velocity and direction. <br />
It is realized via the control from Arduino Uno, along with 2 dimensional servos, a tiny weather vane and a self-made encoder.<br /><br />
